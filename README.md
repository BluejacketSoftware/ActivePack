![Logo](https://github.com/lvcabral/ActivePack/blob/master/activepack-logo.png?raw=true)

## The Project

ActivePack is a collection of ActiveX controls designed to be used with MicrosoftÂ® Visual Basic 6, they were created during my ActiveX technology studies around 1998, I was looking to make simple, useful an practical controls, that would cover some needs that the Visual Basic with it's native controls doesn't cover. 
This was an active freeware project until 2002. I'm now opening the source code under a new license (see below).

## The Controls

- **ActiveForm**: Add new properties to a Form. You can configure minimum and maximum size,turn off the close windows button (the X button), turns your form Always-On-Top, resize the form controls proportionaly when it resizes, change the form background to several types of gradient, or tile a wallpaper picture. You can also enable the "Minimize To Tray" feature to your form only setting a property to True.

- **ActiveCombo**: ComboBox that allows you to use icons and indent the list items. Very powerful and simple to use. You can use it's internal ImageList or an external one.

- **ActiveStatus**: A StatusBar that reproduces the Microsoft StatusBar Inteface containded on the Commctl32.ocx, here you only have the control you want, don't need to send a large file.

- **ActiveText**: Textbox with filter and dynamic numeric mask. It has pre-configured masks to Integer Numbers, Floating Point Numbers, Date, Time, Phone Numbers, Brazilian CEP, Brazilian CGC and Brazilian CPF. You can also create a custom mask. To ordinary Text it has Upper Case, Lower Case and Proper Case filters.

- **ActiveDate**: TextBox with a PopUp Calendar, it's simple, cute and easy to use.

- **ActiveCalendar**: A Simple Calendar Control.

- **ActiveLink**: To put Hyperlink Label's on you Form's

- **ActivePanel**: Simple 3D panel and 3D Line

- **ActiveScroll**: Control to put ScrollBars on forms and make possible use these forms on smaller screen resolutions.

There is also in ActivePack an application called **ActiveX Tools**, it allows you to search for files/libraries, and compare its name, versions, date, size, GUID, OLE Interface version and you can register and unregister your ActiveX components (OCX, DLL and EXE) in groups of chosen files.
